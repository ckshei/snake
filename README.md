Classic game of Snake

## Getting Started

Open up index.html in Google Chrome. (I haven't tested the other browsers). Controls are handled with the arrow keys. Make sure you click on the game map to trigger the actions.

## Game Settings

The snake starts off by moving to the right, and is 1 'block' long. 

There is no start button, so the snake will start moving right away. When the game ends (upon the snake's collision with the wall, or itself) the game will restart automatically. 


## Next Steps

Everything is globally scoped here as I was building this rather quickly. I'll most likely not want to globally scope all my variables as I clean this up.

I would have preferred to create a start and pause button, and a 'game over' screen / animation. 

I also find the classic Snake to be rather boring, so I think it would be interesting if we incorporated a 2 player version. The first person to collide with a wall, the other snake's body, or into themselves, loses.
